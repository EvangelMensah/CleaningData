CleaningData
============
Pls Note:

    Install 'reshape' and 'reshape2' packages ( the script will try to do that as well )
    The directory "UCI HAR Dataset" should be in the working directory of your R ( getwd() )
    Copy the script file to the working directory of your R. Please ensure that the data files and the script are a part of same R working directory.
    The script processes data for mean and std columns, meanFreq columns have also been ignored
    The script has also been commented with each step explained correctly, please refer that in case of any confussion
